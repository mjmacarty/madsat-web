<p>The first major battle of the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> after independence was declared—and the largest battle of the entire war—was fought in New York at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island" title="Battle of Long Island">Battle of Long Island</a> (a.k.a. <i>Battle of Brooklyn</i>) in August 1776.

More than 5&nbsp;million acres (20,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of former Iroquois territory was put up for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War, leading to rapid development in upstate New York.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> As per the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)" title="Treaty of Paris (1783)">Treaty of Paris</a>, the last vestige of British authority in the former <a href="/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies" title="Thirteen Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a>—their troops in New York City—departed in 1783, which was long afterwards celebrated as <a href="/wiki/Evacuation_Day_(New_York)" title="Evacuation Day (New York)">Evacuation Day</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

That government was found to be insufficient, and prominent New Yorker <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> advocated for a new government that would included an executive, national courts, and the power to tax. Hamilton led the <a href="/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_(1786)" title="Annapolis Convention (1786)">Annapolis Convention (1786)</a> which called for the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention" title="Philadelphia Convention" class="mw-redirect">Philadelphia Convention</a> that created the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, and he also participated in.

<p>Transportation in western New York was difficult before canals were built in the early part of the 19th century. The <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River" title="Hudson River">Hudson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mohawk_River" title="Mohawk River">Mohawk</a> Rivers could be navigated only as far as Central New York.

<p>Governor <a href="/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton" title="DeWitt Clinton">DeWitt Clinton</a> strongly advocated building a canal to connect the Hudson River with <a href="/wiki/Lake_Erie" title="Lake Erie">Lake Erie</a>, and thus all of the Great Lakes.

<p>New York City has been the largest <a href="/wiki/Port_of_entry" title="Port of entry">port of entry</a> for immigration into the United States since the early 19th century and continues as such. In the United States, although <a href="/wiki/List_of_United_States_immigration_legislation" title="List of United States immigration legislation">immigration acts</a> had been passed, there was no formal routine for implementing immigration policy on a national level until the <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">federal government</a> assumed direct jurisdiction in 1890.

<p>Ellis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the <a href="/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924" title="Immigration Act of 1924">National Origins Act</a> was passed in 1924, then the only immigrants to pass through there were displaced persons or war refugees. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954 when the last person detained on the island, a <a href="/wiki/Norwegians" title="Norwegians">Norwegian</a> seaman named Arne Peterssen who had overstayed his shore leave was released.

<p>More than 12 million immigrants had passed through Ellis Island, between 1892 and 1954 and today, over 100 million Americans can trace their ancestry to the immigrants, who first arrived in America through Castle Clinton and Ellis Island, before settling throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Due to its long history, the state of New York has several overlapping (and often conflicting) definitions of regions within the state.
