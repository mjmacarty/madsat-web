<p>This results in the array: </p>
<p>I then want to get rid of all patterns matching NL: so I am left with just a natural language question or statement. To accomplish this, I convert the array to a string , and then use .split() to create the desired array like so:</p>
<p>There are two problems I am having. 1. I end up with an extra value of an empty string at index [0] in the resulting array, and 2. I now have a comma literal appended to the strings in the array:</p>
<p>How can I eliminate these problems? Also If someone has a more elegant approach to reading a big ugly text file delimited by line breaks and isolating strings of interest I am all eyes. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions. </p>
<p>You don't have to convert the array to a string, then remove the <code>NL:</code> strings and convert back to an array, just iterate over the array and remove that string in each index</p>

<p>a regular for loop would also work if older browsers is an issue</p>
