I am reading data from a text file and I am interested in a specific pattern that I have isolated with the following: This results in the array: I then want to get rid of all patterns matching NL: so I am left with just a natural language question or statement. To accomplish this, I convert the array to a string , and then use .split() to create the desired array like so: There are two problems I am having. 1. I end up with an extra value of an empty string at index [0] in the resulting array, and 2. I now have a comma literal appended to the strings in the array: How can I eliminate these problems? Also If someone has a more elegant approach to reading a big ugly text file delimited by line breaks and isolating strings of interest I am all eyes. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. You don't have to convert the array to a string, then remove the NL: strings and convert back to an array, just iterate over the array and remove that string in each index FIDDLE a regular for loop would also work if older browsers is an issue Warning : map is not supported by IE8 and below.
